Integer & float mixed operations\n","\n","We considered briefly the concept of type, and noted that `1` is a different type from `1.0`. What happens when you add these types together? Does the order matter? Try different mixed operations ( +, -, *, / ) of integer and float values, and reverse the order of each. In each case, mentally note how the types of the input are reflected in the type of the output.\n","\n","Show your work here, and below state your general observation about mixed operations with integers and floats."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"clUK8He-M1EH"},"source":["print(1 + 1.0)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yeI526yQNQ2r"},"source":["### General observations about integer/float mixed operations:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TJcSX0GgNe8b"},"source":["### 2.
