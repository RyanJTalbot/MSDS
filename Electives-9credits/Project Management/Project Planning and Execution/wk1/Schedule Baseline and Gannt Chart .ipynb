    "Now that we have determined the project’s critical path, durations, and slack, it is time to develop the project schedule baseline. According to PMI, the schedule baseline is, “the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results.  It is accepted and approved by the appropriate stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates.” \n",
