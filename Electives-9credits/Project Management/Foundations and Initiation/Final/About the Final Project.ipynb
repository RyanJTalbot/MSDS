    "\n",
    "Each week you have analyzed your peers’ project documents and have also received valuable feedback to make improvements to your project plan. For your final project, you will revise and resubmit your first three Honors Lessons Projects based on the feedback you have received. \n",

    "Begin by reviewing the suggestions from your evaluators. Then, decide what you should revise. You will also be asked to reflect upon these revisions or suggestions. Be open to their suggestions, but perhaps you may disagree with your peers' analysis.  That is ok. If you don’t feel that their suggestion is appropriate to your project, provide justification in the summary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to take some time to reflect upon what you have learned in this course.  How will you apply the concepts to your current or future career?  In this assignment you will also discuss your two key takeaways from the course.  What has impacted you the most?  What will you incorporate into your work or personal life?  \n",
