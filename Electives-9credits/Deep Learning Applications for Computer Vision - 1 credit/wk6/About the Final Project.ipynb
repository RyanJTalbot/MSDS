    "# About the Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Final Project we will explore algorithms used in Facial Recognition. As recent research pointed out (The Gender Shades project: [gendershades](http://gendershades.org)  , current face recognition systems have substantial disparities in accuracy when applied to pictures of darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Final Project is providing the learner with two possible solutions to address the skin-based and gender-based disparities in face recognition systems. The solutions are trying to address the lack of data which leads to the low representation of some categories, as evidenced by the disparities in accuracy. One choice uses a classic Computer Vision algorithm (Viola & Jones [approach](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) ). The other choice is Deep Learning based (Deep Face Recognition [model](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf) ). \n",
