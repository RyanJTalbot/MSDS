    "# Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how to solve TSPs in this module and in particular presented two approaches to encode a TSP as an integer linear program. In this problem, we will ask you to adapt the TSP solution to the related problem of $k$ Travelling Salespeople Problem ($k$-TSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G$ be a complete graph with $n$ vertices that we will label $0, \\ldots, n-1$ (keeping Python array indexing in mind). Our costs are specified using a matrix $C$ wherein $C_{i,j}$ is the cost of the edge from vertex $i$ to $j$ for $i \\not= j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we have $k \\geq 1$ salespeople who must  start from vertex $0$ of the graph (presumably the location of the sales office) and together visit every location in the graph,  each returning back to vertex $0$. Each location must be visited exactly once by some salesperson in the team. Therefore, other than vertex $0$ (the start/end vertex of every salesperson's tour), no two salesperson tours have a vertex in common. Notice that for $k=1$, this is just the regular TSP problem we have studied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, all $k$ salespeople must be employed in the tour. In other words, if we have $k=3$ then each salesperson must start at $0$ and visit a sequence of one or more vertices and come back to $0$. No salesperson can be \"idle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a graph with $5$ nodes and the following cost matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n",
    "  \\text{Vertices} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ \n",

    " 4 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 5 & - \\\\ \n",
    " \\end{array}$$\n",
    " \n",
    " For instance $C_{2,3}$ the cost of edge from vertex $2$ to $3$ is $5$. The $-$ in the diagonal entries simply tells us that we do not care what goes in there since we do not have self-loops in the graph.\n",
    " \n",
    "The optimal $2$-TSP tour for $k=2$ salespeople is shown below.\n",
    "  - Salesperson # 1: $0 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 0$.\n",
    "  - Salesperson # 2: $0 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 0$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The total cost of the edges traversed by the two salespeople equals $12$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $k=3$, the optimal $3-$ TSP tour is as shown below.\n",
    "  - Salesperson # 1: $0 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4$, \n",
    "  - Salesperson # 2: $0 \\rightarrow 2$, \n",
    "  - Salesperson # 3: $0 \\rightarrow 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost is $16$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this problem is to formulate an ILP using the MTZ approach."
