It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch.  It's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months, the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside.

All of this is nothing compared to the time when it became necessary to replace the battery (less than one year with both watches).  I didn't have the necessary special tools to replace the battery.  Replacing the battery was a major accomplishment. I could not get the first watch to work after replacing the battery.

I had mine for six weeks, worn as a normal watch(at my inside job), and the case was scratched and dinged as if it was 10 years old.

The rubber tore where it attached to the case---and that was simply from taking the watch off. No bike crashes, no playing sports. Just removing it. At that time, the yellow in the engraved Lance Armstrong signature on the case back had also come off. As a matter of fact, it actually stuck to my wrist.

Given that the electronics in this thing must weigh nothing, it's obvious that Nike has packed the case with redundant chunks of metal to make it so heavy. Just wearing it for a day gives your arm a workout! However, if you're in the market for an eye-catching big digital watch that has a clear display with large numerals that shows all the basic information (time, seconds, date), that's fairly affordable then this might be the one for you.If you want a similar watch that's not so big, check out the Nike Blade watch - the styling is less dramatic, but it won't break your wrist to the same degree.\", \"Very disappointed about this product.

What's that, a drop of 2 feet and the impact caused the display to malfunction?  I can't even read the time, much less the stop watch.

Something about walking on a bubble of air always fascinated me. But this year I think Nike missed the mark. The most obvious change is to the tongue of the shoe. Or whatever this thing is called. It's extremely thin made of some type of nylon. Reminds me of the same material rain jackets are made of. It's so thin I have doubts it will last very long. Its like a flap of fabric, no cushion to it at all. The tongue is so thin and small that I have a hard time grabbing the thing when pulling them on me feet.  I typically buy new Nike once a year. But the feel of these shoes does not instill confidence in me that they will make the entire year. Maybe it's just me. But I feel prior versions were made of better material. I will keep them simply because I need new shoes. But if I had seen these in the store before I made my purchase online, I probably would have chosen a different year model. Don't get me wrong, they are still Nike Air max. And if you wear Nike as much as I wear Nike,  then they will do just fine. I just don't like them compared to prior versions and I think the tongue is a cheap thin piece of ----. That's my two cents. Still a good shoe.\", \"I have foot problems and this is the one running shoe that I can use that doesn't break down and make my feet hurt within a couple months.

They last 9 months to a year of almost daily use.  They have a very stiff sole which gives you the support you need while running or walking.  Test your shoes by trying to bend them in half.  If they bend, that means there is very little support and your foot isn't suppose to bend that way.  These Nikes never bend and are super firm.  Run on my friends.

Keep in mind that sneaker fit is something unique to each person which is why its important to go to a store and have them check how you walk/run and they can recommend the proper sneaker or insoles for you. They are very durable as I tried my best to kill them but they wouldnt die..lol. I hated these sneakers more than anything I have ever put my feet in.

I usually wear size 7 flip flops and found the fit to be alright with thin sports socks. If I could choose again I would have gone with size 8.5 because the tip of the shoes are narrow while my feet are a bit broad.The shoe feels solid and I think it is much better as a walking shoe than a running or sprinting shoe. This is because of its solid construct and inflexibility. A website says it weighs 6oz but it somehow feels heavier than the Nike Zoom Waffle Racer V men's shoes (7.5oz based on size 9) that I just bought.The soles of the shoe are made up of little squares which wore out quickly and which provide insufficient grip on wet surfaces. I do not need to be as cautious sprinting on dry gravel as I am on wet gravel. But on dry gravel I can still feel the lack of traction. When it is raining or has rained I do not dare to go hard on sprints and cannot go hard anyway because I can feel the shoes slipping instead of gripping.I do not jog or do endurance running in these shoes and they seem to have worn out pretty quickly.

This little device helped motivate me to run farther.  One thing I was worried about at first was that my running shoes (also nike) didn't have the little nike plus insert in them.  Online I found a little holder that tied into my laces so that I could use this watch with my favorite running shoes no matter what brand they were.  It tracks calories, time, and distance.  Also, you can log into nike's site and it can track your runs, and you can join different activities.  I joined groups like 30 miles in 30 days or 365 miles in 365 days.  Every time you logged in it would track your runs and load them into your profile so that you wcould see you were closer to that goal.  It also has the capability to sync your runs to your facebook page.  This feature kept me running.  Sometimes if I had a crappy day and didn't feel like running I would start my nike+ watch then think forget this I'm stopping or I'm not running anymore I'm just gonna walk. I would remember the next time I logged it it would say Tera's last run was .10 miles or Tera's last run was 2 miles and took 35 minutes.  I didn't want the whole world to see when I was lazy and slacking, so in the end I would suck it up and run anyways knowing my nike+ watch would tell on me if I didn't.

So here goes:If you like shoes that squeak and embarrass you, then these Nike Air Monarchs are for you. I bought a pair out of state, so returning them to the retailer was not feasible. So I contacted Nike customer service. Now, most companies will simply replace defective product.  Not Nike. You get to send them back at your own expense and they will \"determine whether they replaceable or not.\"A visit to the Nike website was really eye-opening.  Review after review complained about the squeak in these shoes. It\\'s pretty obvious to me that Nike couldn\\'t care less about this negative feedback or they would have addressed the issue long ago.Needless to say, I\\'ve given up on the Nike brand entirely, and the only consolation for all my wasted time and money is to be able to tell everyone my Nike squeak story and to tell them that IMO, Nike has become a third rate company.  I would strongly recommend you avoid Nike, until they stop selling products they (should) know are defective, and stop ignoring customer complaints.BTW, I finally went back to the out-of-town retailer where I purchased them and they replaced them - with another pair that squeaks even worse.

I think I might try once again but Nike: LISTEN UP.. you probably can hear your quality failure right out in your own warehouses- on the very feet used by your employees.

Everyday it seems like it is slowly getting worse, and I fear this pair will not even get close to lasting a year.What is not as annoying as a loose thong sandal, though very disappointing, is something aesthetically wrong with a Nike product.

I have been wearing these boots now for about a week and I am surprised to say I have to agree with all of the other reviewers out there that these boots are in fact comfortable to wear.  They don't feel overly clunky, or heavy and I can walk around in these boots all day without any weird rubbing or discomfort.

I walked miles and miles on end and I did not suffer from any hot spots or blisters.  My feet were sore and fatigued but that's normal wear and tear from walking and standing around for 8-12 hours a day.  These boots held up so well!

I then tried em without socks and they felt 100 times better!  I concluded that these shoes are meant to be worn without socks: 1) Their hard to put on with socks on. 2) Their too tight with socks on. 3) They're easier to put on without socks. 4) The opening of the shoe looks to be an imitation of an ankle sock.  Yes use them for running. You'll feel lighter. The shoelace is for looks really and serves no real function.

Didn't like a thick wallet in my back pocket.  This really worked well for me!  I have room for 4-5 credit cards on one side and 2-3 on the other.
