    "## Objective\n",
    "I want to use this data to help predict the conditions and personal traits for people that take coupons when they are driving past. This will help the employees of those companies to better give out those coupons and to avoid conditions where people are less likely to accept them. The data includes both personal traits, weather conditions, and range of the establishment from the place that coupons are being given out. \n",

    "\n",
    "Note: While deciding when and where to give out coupons the employees will not be able to have personal trait details, but given the insight into the data we will be able to at least provide them with insight into external factors. "
