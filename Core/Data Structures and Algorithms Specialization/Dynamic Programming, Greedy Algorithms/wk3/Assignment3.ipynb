Going through each and every one of them to find out the one that will minimize the makespan is impractical.  Furthermore, next module will study NP completeness. We will see that some problems including makespan scheduling are somehow inherently harder to solve on a computer.

    "$M_j = \\sum_{ i = 1}^{n} T_i \\times [A_i = j] $ wherein the function $[A_i = j]$ equals $1$ if $A_i = j$ and $0$ otherwise. \n",

    "\n",
    "The times taken by each processor are $M_1 = 4, M_2 = 7, M_3 = 4$. The makespan is $7$.\n",

    "$\\hat{A}: [ 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]$ this assignment achieves a makespan of $6$.\n",

    "Each job can be assignment to one of 10 possible choices in terms of processors. The number of assignments is\n",
    "$m^n$ or $10^{1000}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 4\n",
    "The running time as written is $\\Theta(nm)$. However, if we maintain a priority queue for $M$ where the priority is given by its current load, then using extract min, we can get the minimum load processor in $\\Theta(1)$. Also, we will need $\\Theta(\\log(m))$ time to bubble down when the load for processor $M[j]$ goes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Take $n$ jobs of time 1 and one job of time $n$ and schedule it over $m$ processors. The greedy algorithm will have a makespan of roughly $\\frac{n}{m} + n$ whereas the best solution is to distribute the first $n$ jobs over\n",
    "the $m-1$ processors and then have the last job on the remaining processor, yielding a makespan of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that processor $k$'s current total job allocation is $M_k$. Let processor $j$ have the minimum total load so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have that $ M_j \\leq M_k$ for all $k \\in \\{ 1, \\ldots, m \\}$. Thus, $M_1 + M_2 + \\cdots + M_m \\geq m M_j$.\n",
    "But what is $M_i$: it is the sum of job times that have been assigned to processor $i$. Therefore, the sum of all job times must exceed the sum of the times for the individual processors since each job is assigned to at most one processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LHS is bounded as follows:\n",
    "$$ T_1 + T_2 + \\cdots + T_n \\geq M_1 + M_2 + \\cdots + M_m \\geq m M_j \\,.$$\n",
    "This yields the fact that $M_j \\leq \\frac{1}{m} \\left( T_1 + \\cdots + T_n \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 7\n",
    "\n",
    "The jobs should be sorted in descending order for the best performance.  To see why, let us go back to the key property of the greedy algorithm: when it assigns a job to processor j, the total load currently assigned to processor j must be less than the average (total of all job times divided by the number of processors). Thus, let us freeze the algorithm at the point when it assigns a job to the processor j that causes the worst total time (i.e the makespan) to be achieved. Since jobs are sorted in descending order, this job has to be smaller than the largest job $T_{max}$. In fact, a slightly more detailed analysis will show that this job will be less than half the make span of the optimal solution.  \n"
