    "# Assessing the fit of the binomial regression model \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will discuss the deviance as a measure of the goodness of fit. It is important to note that these goodness of fit metrics only hold when the number of trials for our binomial regression is relatively large (say, roughly greater than 5). **In particular, that means that these metrics are not useful for the case where the response is a 0-1 Bernoulli.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reminder: Goodness of fit in the normal linear regression framework\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that, under the assumption that the normal linear model was correct, the coefficient of determination was used as a measure of how well the model fits the data. The coefficient of determination was defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, the extent to which the model fits the data is given in the residual sum of squares, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$RSS = \\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i)^2.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "After all, the RSS is what we minimized to estimate our parameters, $\\boldsymbol\\beta$, so the smaller it is, the better fit we have (again, assuming that the regression assumptions are correct). The limiting case is that the RSS is zero, which means that every deviation $y_i - \\widehat{y}_i = 0$, which means that the data perfectly fall on our regression line/surface, and the model fits perfectly. **In this lesson, our goal will be to find analogous goodness of fit metrics for the binomial regression model. We will also briefly mention analogs to the F-tests from normal linear regression.**\n",

    "#### Deviance as a measure of goodness of fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the *deviance* of a GLM is -2 times the log likelihood of the GLM evaluated at the MLEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D = -2\\ell(\\, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\beta} \\,) = -2\\sum^n_{i=1} \\bigg[ y_i\\eta_i - n_i\\log\\big(1 + e^{\\eta_i}\\big) + \\log{n_i \\choose y_i}\\bigg]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If our modeling assumptions are correct, a smaller deviance means a better fit, in just the same way that a smaller residual sum of squares meant a better fit in normal regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few special cases of the deviance that will be useful for assessing goodness of fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *The null deviance*. The null deviance is the deviance for the null model - i.e., the model with just an intercept term, and no predictors. In this case, $p_i = \\bar{y}$, and the *null deviance* is \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "D_{null} &= -2\\sum^n_{i=1} \\bigg[ y_i\\eta_i - n_i\\log\\big(1 + e^{\\eta_i}\\big) + \\log{n_i \\choose y_i}\\bigg] \\\\\n",
    "&= -2\\sum^n_{i=1}\\bigg[ y_i\\log\\bigg(\\frac{\\bar{y}}{1 - \\bar{y}} \\bigg) - n_i\\log\\big(1 + \\exp{\\bigg\\{ {\\log\\bigg(\\frac{\\bar{y}}{1 - \\bar{y}} \\bigg)} \\bigg\\} }\\big) + \\log{n_i \\choose y_i}\\bigg] \\\\\n",
    "&= -2\\sum^n_{i=1}\\bigg[ y_i\\log\\bigg(\\frac{\\bar{y}}{1 - \\bar{y}} \\bigg) - n_i\\log\\big(1 + \\bigg(\\frac{\\bar{y}}{1 - \\bar{y}} \\bigg)\\big) + \\log{n_i \\choose y_i}\\bigg]\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *The saturated deviance*. This is the deviance of the saturated model - i.e., the model where each data point has it's own unique parameter. In this case, the MLE is $\\widehat p_i = y_i\\big/n_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "D_{sat} &= -2\\sum^n_{i=1} \\bigg[ y_i\\eta_i - n_i\\log\\big(1 + e^{\\eta_i}\\big) + \\log{n_i \\choose y_i}\\bigg]  = -2\\sum^n_{i=1}\\bigg[ \\bigg] \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *The residual deviance*. The residual deviance is the difference between the deviance for a given model of interest - e.g., the one you've fit for your data in R - and the saturated model. Let's use the notation $D_p$ for the deviance of the model of interest (one with $p$ predictors). Then the residual deviance can be shown to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "D_{resid} = D_{p} - D_{sat} &=  -2\\sum^n_{i=1}\\bigg[{y_i}\\log\\bigg(\\frac{y_i}{\\widehat y_i} \\bigg) + (n_i - y_i)\\log\\bigg(\\frac{n_i - y_i }{ n_i - \\widehat y_i}\\bigg)  \\bigg] \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, when $n_i > 5$ for all $i = 1,...,n$, it can be shown that the residual deviance (and more generally, any difference in deviances) follows a $\\chi^2$ distribution. Under the null hypothesis that the $p$ model fits the data, the degrees of freedom will be the degrees of freedom of $D_{p}$ minus the degrees of freedom of $D_{sat}$. So, in our case: $df(D_{resid}) = (n-(p+1)) - (n - n) = n-(p+1)$. Thus, we can use $D_{resid} \\sim \\chi^2\\big(n - p+1 \\big)$ in a test of the fit of our model. The hypotheses under consideration are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0: \\text{The model with } p \\text{ parameters fits well enough.} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, vs. \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, H_1: \\text{The model with } p \\text{ parameters does not fit well enough.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will reject the null hypothesis when $D_{resid}$ is too large (an upper-tailed chi-squared test).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Challenger data\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1986 crash of the space shuttle Challenger was linked to failure of O-ring seals in the rocket engines. Data was collected on the 23 previous shuttle missions. The launch temperature on the day of the crash was 31F. The `orings` dataframe contains 23 observations on the following 2 variables.\n",
