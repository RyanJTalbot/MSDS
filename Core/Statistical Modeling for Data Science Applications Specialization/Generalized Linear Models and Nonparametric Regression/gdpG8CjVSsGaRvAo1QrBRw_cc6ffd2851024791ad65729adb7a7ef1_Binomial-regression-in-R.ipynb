    "The data that we'll explore come from the [University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+#). The original work was published in \"Accurate occupancy detection of an office room from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 measurements using statistical learning models\". Luis M. Candanedo, Véronique Feldheim. *Energy and Buildings*. Volume 112, 15 January 2016, Pages 28-39.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables in the dataset include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. date: time year-month-day hour:minute:second \n",
    "2. Temperature: in Celsius \n",
    "3. Relative Humidity: as a percentage\n",
    "4. Light: measured in Lux \n",
    "5. CO2: in ppm \n",
    "6. Humidity Ratio: Derived quantity from temperature and relative humidity, in kgwater-vapor/kg-air \n",
    "7. Occupancy: 0 for not occupied, 1 for occupied status\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to predict occupancy using these variables as predictors. Note that the dataset also includes dates and a humidity ratio, which we will ignore for simplicity. To load the data, we'll use the ${\\tt RCurl}$ package."

Exponentiating, the average odds are $\\approx 1.84 \\times 10^{-13}$, basically, zero. That seems to make some sense.
