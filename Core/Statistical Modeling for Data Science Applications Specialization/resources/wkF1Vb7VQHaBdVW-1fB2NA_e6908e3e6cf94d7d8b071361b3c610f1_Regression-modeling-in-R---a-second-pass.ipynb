We should be caseful in comparing $R^2$ across models with a different number of predictors; $R^2$ will always increase when adding a predictor.

In doing so, we know how the data were generated. With the simulated data (sometimes called \"synthetic data\"), we can fit various models - models that are correct, and models that are incorrect - and study how those models perform on data with known relationships.*\n",

We'll generate the predictors, $x_i$ randomly from the interval $(0,1)$. This model will be identifiable."

    "Here, we notice that the coefficients table does not have any `NA` values. The reason for this is because, strictly speaking, the model is identifiable. However, there are problems with the fit. Notice that the estimate for $\\beta_2$ is negative, but that the true $\\beta_2 = 2$ is positive. This can easily happen with collinear data (for reasons that we will understand soon!), and is a sign that `x3` is a near constant multiple of `x1`. \n",

    "Note that, if we were working with real data - data for which we didn't know the data generating process - it wouldn't necessarily be clear that that the sign of the estimate of the parameter is different from the true parameter. But, you may have reasons to believe that the sign is off, e.g., if you have good theoretical reasons to believe that `x3` and `y` ought to be positively correlated but the sign of the estimate is negative. There are other methods to diagnose and deal with collinear data, and we'll look at some of them in a later lesson!"
