    "Suppose that each of these factors is negatively associated with the response — for example, an abrasion decreases the amount of pressure needed to have the rope fail. However, rope failure is actually largely due to a fourth variable, namely, whether the rope has been \"fatigued\" (that is, whether a climber has fallen on it before). Which condition for causal reasoning from experimental data is not met?\n",
