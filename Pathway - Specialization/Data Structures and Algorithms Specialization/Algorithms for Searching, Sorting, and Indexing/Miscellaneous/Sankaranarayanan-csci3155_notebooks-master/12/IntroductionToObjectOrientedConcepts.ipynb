    "\"_I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so messaging came at the very beginning -- it took a while to see how to do messaging in a programming language efficiently enough to be useful)._\" -- Alan Kay (computing pioneer and an early inventor of object oriented programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming is a style of programming that involves creating and manipulating objects/classes. We have already seen objects and used them. Let us summarize their main features:\n",
    "1. Objects have a bunch of members which can be fields or methods. Some languages allow us to classify these fields as public/private.\n",
    "2. The fields encapsulate a bunch of related data items and the methods encapsulate a bunch of operations that can apply to these data items. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are objects (and how are they different from classes)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a type and an object is an instance of that type.\n",

    "Here is an example of a class `A`. It has member fields `t1, t2` and `t3`. It also has methods\n",
