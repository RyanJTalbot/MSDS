    "Previously, we examined inductive definitions starting with numbers, lists, binary trees, arithmetic expressions and a simple imperative language. However, beyond defining them, we did not do much else with them. In this lecture, we will fix this by performing a variety of exciting operations on inductively defined structures we have defined so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine two mechanisms for defining these operations: \n",
    "1. Using a *visitor pattern*: i.e, implement the operation as a member function as we will see.\n",
    "2. Using pattern matching: this is a special feature of functional languages like Scala, Lisp, Caml and Haskell. Although you will find libraries in Python (https://github.com/grantjenks/python-pattern-matching) and C++ (https://github.com/solodon4/Mach7) that can mimic this very powerful feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first option is generically applicable to most languages. The second one is very special and very powerful. We will focus extensively on the second option of pattern matching, while mentioning what a visitor pattern is.\n",
