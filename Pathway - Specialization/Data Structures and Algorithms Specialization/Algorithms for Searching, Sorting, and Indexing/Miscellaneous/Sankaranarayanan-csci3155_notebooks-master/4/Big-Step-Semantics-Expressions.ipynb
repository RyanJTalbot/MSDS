    "We wrote a simple and intuitive function `evalExpr` but how do we talk about what it does? A simple answer is that the code can be read by anyone who knows Scala and therefore can serve to document the meaning of expressions in terms of what they do. This is surely a path to disaster for more complicated languages. It is important therefore to use some kind of notation to explain how to understand the behavior of the `evalExpr` function at a high level and in a language independent fashion. We will use \"big step\" semantics to notate this process and see how the code we have written so far is simply a translation of the big step semantics into code.\n",
