    "environment work in the Lettuce language with arithmetic expressions, boolean expressions and let bindings. The lecture will be structured as follows:\n",
    "  - We will first recall notions of scope and shadowing.\n",

    "  - In particular, we examine how the recursive interpreter produces the correct handling of scopes. \n",

    "\n",
    "Programs define and use identifiers (these can be constant vals or mutable vars) all over the place. The scope of a definition/declaration in a program specifies __where__ in the program that particular definition/declaration is used. \n",

    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the example above, there are two declarations/definitions using let bindings, as noted in the comments. There are two usages of `x` in the program and one usage of `y`. The following two points should be clear to the reader:\n",
    "  - Which declaration/definition is being referred to by the respective usages of `x` and `y` in the code.\n",

    "    - The environment is `env3` is created by adding the binding $y \\mapsto NumValue(65)$ to `env1`. Thus, `env3` is the environment $\\{ x \\mapsto NumValue(20), y \\mapsto NumValue(65) \\}$.\n",
