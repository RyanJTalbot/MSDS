    "In this lecture, we will study inductive definitions: a very important form that can be used  to define a lot of _rich_ structures. In turn,  we can use inductive definitions to design and implement programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use inductive definitions for a variety of purposes starting from \n",
    "defining *numbers*, *lists*, *trees*, *syntax trees*, *expressions* and \n",
    "so on.  Learning how to define these and implement various important \n",
    "operations on them will be at the absolute core of this class.\n",

    "## Natural Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, \\}$ has an inductive definition that we will state in three different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Definition in  English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural numbers are defined inductively using the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **R0:** The symbol $\\text{Z}$ is a natural number (side note: it stands for the number *zero*)\n",
    "  - **R1:** If $s$ is a natural number then $\\text{succ}(s)$ is a natural number (side note: *succ* stands for the act of adding one to a number giving us its *succ*essor).\n",
    "  - **R2:** Nothing else is a natural number.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This definition provides us a handle to generate the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ in \n",
    "countably-many stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule **R0** tells us that $N_0 = \\{ Z \\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can apply the rule **R1** to derive more natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{array}{rl}\n",
    "N_0: & \\{ Z \\} \\\\\n",
    "N_1: & \\{ Z, \\text{succ}(Z) \\}\\\\\n",
    "N_2: &  \\{Z, \\text{succ}(Z), \\text{succ}(\\text{succ}(Z)) \\} \\\\\n",
    "N_3: &  \\{Z, \\text{succ}(Z), \\text{succ}(\\text{succ}(Z)), \\text{succ}^{3}(Z) \\} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\\\\n",
    "N_k: &  \\{ Z, \\text{succ}(Z), \\text{succ}(\\text{succ}(Z)),  \\cdots, \\text{succ}^{k}(Z) \\} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \n",
    "\\end{array}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\text{succ}^k(Z)$ is simply the application of $\\text{succ}$ $k$-times to the symbol $Z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strings Z, succ(Z), succ(succ(Z)), succ(succ(succ(Z))) are called __terms__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we iterate this process forever, _in the limit_ we  obtain the set $\\mathbb{N}$ defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{N} = N_0 \\cup N_1 \\cup N_2 \\cup N_3 \\cup \\cdots \\cup N_{j} \\cup \\cdots = \\bigcup_{j=0}^{\\infty} N_j \\,.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks nothing like the natural numbers $0,1, 2,3, \\ldots$ that we learned in grade school (and appreciated dearly ever since!).  Nevertheless, we can identify every number $k$ with the term $\\text{succ}^{k}(Z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Definition as a Generative Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "The english definition will soon be cumbersome to write down. Therefore, we define a _generative grammar_ that\n",
    "generates the same definition as a convenient mathematical shorthand. The grammar is as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    " \\textbf{Number} & \\rightarrow &   \\text{Z}\\\\\n",
    "  \\textbf{Number} & \\rightarrow&  succ(\\textbf{Number}) \\\\ \n",
    "                  \\end{array}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us help you make sense of a grammar by giving names to every part.\n",
    "   - Nonterminal: The symbol __Number__ is a non terminal for the grammar. \n",
    "   - Terminals: The symbols *Z, succ* are called terminals for the grammar. \n",
    "   - Rules: There are two rules in the grammar: __Number__ -> Z and __Number__ -> succ(__Number__). If we translate them into plain english, what do we get:\n",
    "     - **R0** The term consisting of just the symbol Z is a __Number__.\n",
    "     - **R1** If the term t is a __Number__ then succ(t) is also a __Number__.\n",
    "   - Starting Symbol (Nonterminal): We designate one of the nonterminals of the grammar as starting. Here there is just one such non terminal __Number__ and therefore it is the starting symbol.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "__Definition (Generative Grammar)__ \n",
    "A generative grammar is defined by three components:  (1) A set of nonterminals, (2) A set of terminals, and (C) A set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each rule has the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "__NonTerminalSymbol__ -> _(a term involving terminal and non terminal symbols)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing out each rule, we collect rules with a common left hand side and use the OR symbol `|` to separate them. For example, we can write the very same grammar for natural numbers as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n",
    "\\textbf{Number} & \\rightarrow & {Z} &\\ |\\ & succ(\\textbf{number}) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every term generated by the grammar is derived from the starting symbol by the application of grammar rules. Here are some examples of derivations: \n",
    "\n",
    "   - succ(Z) \n",
    "     - __Number__ -> succ(__Number__) -> succ(Z)\n",
    "   - succ(succ(succ(Z)))\n",
    "     - __Number__ -> succ(__Number__) -> succ(succ(__Number__)) -> succ(succ(succ(__Number__))) -> succ(succ(succ(Z)))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive Definition in Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala (and indeed many other languages) have a way for us to provide inductive definitions. We do so in scala using the class inheritence mechanism as follows."
