    "## Garbage Collection using Reference Counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first study the fragment of the language __without function calls/recursion__.  Once we handle this fragment, we will study the fragment with function calls, closures and such to complete the handling of garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A reference count is associated with each cell in the store that counts how many vars in the environment refer to a given cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In particular, if the reference count is zero for a cell, then there is no way to access that cell from the environment. It can be \"garbage collected\": i.e, its contents replaced on the next allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counting is a seamless approach to garbage collection. All it needs is a way for us to indicate at each cell how many references exist to that cell. How is this done? \n",
    "This is how: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - When a let binding or a let var binding happens, we note that a new identifier comes in scope. \n",
    "    - If the identifier that just came in scope is bound to a reference to a cell in the memory, __increment__ its reference count.\n",
    "    - Note that incrementing the reference count of one cell may trigger reference count increases for other cells as well. How?\n",
    "      - Imagine a cell address i whose contents are themselves a reference to another cell with address j.\n",
    "      - It is important that if reference count of i goes up by 1, then so does that for cell j. Likewise, when we decrease reference counts.\n",
    "  - When a let binding finishes evaluating, the identifier it binds goes out of scope.\n",
    "    - Decrement its reference count if the identifier refers to a cell in the memory/if the cell refers to another cell, recursively decrease the ref count for that cell.\n",
    "  - If the reference count for a cell is down to 0, it can be reused upon the next allocation of a new cell.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> Our solution works for both implicit and explicit references. For simplicity, we will demonstrate it for just the language with explicit references. But the language for implicit references works in a similar fashion: in fact it would be somewhat simpler for the implicit language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Example 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how reference counting works.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = newref(10) in \n",
    "let y = newref( let z = newref(15) in  (* z comes into scope *)\n",
    "                 let dummy = assignref(z, deref(x) - 5) in \n",
    "                    deref(z) + 20\n",
    "               ) in (* z goes out of scope here *)\n",
    "      deref(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the execution work with respect to the environment and store? We show below through a sequence of snapshots that include environment shown in yellow and the corresponding store shown as a table in blue. We show how the reference count becomes 0 when z goes out of scope and later, how the cell for y recycles the old cell that used to hold the pointer z.\n",

    "When adding support for function calls, it is important to note that we may have closures whose environments may have captured a reference.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Next, when we have a function call: `fun (arg)`:\n",
    "  - Suppose `fun` is a `Closure(param, body, env)` then if `arg` is a reference to a cell in the memory then `param` is now also a reference to that cell.\n",
    "    - In this case, we need to increment the reference count before starting to execute the body of the function.\n",
    "    - When the function is done executing, we need to decrement the reference count.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Curried function calls pose an extra challenge.\n",
    "  - There is a temporary closure that is created which may change the reference counts as we execute a curried function call.\n",

    "## Reference Counting: Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of reference counting is that garbage collection is seamlessly integrated into the workings of the interpreter. As soon as a memory cell goes out of scope, we can reclaim memory and reuse it. In this sense, it is very memory efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many disadvantages to this scheme:\n",
    "  - Every let binding, function call etc.. has a overhead which can be large if the program has created a complicated structure in the memory.\n",
    "  - Imagine a binary tree implementation with reference counting:\n",
    "     - Every time, we point to the root the garbage collector will automatically increment the reference count of every object. \n",
    "     - This can cause huge hidden performance overheads to implementations.\n",
    "  - Another disadvantage is the extra overhead of storing the reference count for each object. This can easily become nontrivial.\n",
    "  - Yet another disadvantage is when we create reference cycles: for instance in graph data structures or doubly linked list structures. These cycles can break reference counting.\n",
    "  - A  final and very important disadvantage is when we support concurrent threads/processes. When multiple processes/threads share memory the reference counts have to be incremented/decremented atomically. In a multiprocessor system, this has a high overhead including forcing caches to synchronize across different processors. You have to use complicated constructs known as fences if your memory does not have sequential consistency. All of this raises the complexity of the implementation substantially."

    "## Alternatives to Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "There are alternatives which are more popular. You can look up the `Mark and Sweep` garbage collector algorithm that periodically traverses the reachable memory cells and reclaims memory when needed. This means that programs that do not consume much memory can run fast without garbage collection, which is invoked only when the program starts to run out of memory or the fragmentation of the allocated memory is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many JVM implementations use mark and sweep algorithm variants for their garbage collection.  Python on the other hand uses reference counting (at least the CPython implementation does). But it does not handle circular references and it does not do reference counting for all types of objects."
