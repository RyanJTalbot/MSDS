    "# Dynamic Arrays: A Simple Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes will supplement section 17.4 of CLRS book, which covers a lot more than this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A dynamic array is simply an array but it can grow in size to accomodate new elements that are added. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays \n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a \"contiguous chunk\" of random access memory in a computer.  \n",
    "  - Random Access: We can access the individual cells of the array as `a[1]`, `a[2]`, ..., `a[n]`, where  $n$ is the size of the array. \n",
    "  - Reading or writing to the memory element at index `j`  takes $O(1)$ time. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Our goal is to maintain an array of $n$ elements and support the following operations:\n",
    "  - Reading/Writing to a particular index $j$ where $1 \\leq j \\leq n$.\n",
    "  - Adding a new element at the end of the array: the size of the array will become $n+1$ as a result.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Memory Allocator\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difficulty in implementing an array data structure lies in how a process in a computer obtains memory. In all computer operating systems there is a memory management module that allocates memory to running programs. Programs can request a \"contiguous chunk\" of $k$ memory cells using an \"allocation\" function. This function is setup differently in various programming languages. For instance, in python, we can allocate an array of size `k` all initialized with $0$s as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "a = [0]* k\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Note however, that lists in python are already a \"dynamic array\" implemented more or less in the same manner that we are going to describe here. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3917574/how-is-pythons-list-implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "The curious reader may ask about \"deallocation\" or \"freeing\" memory. We note that \n",
    "in some programming environments like C/C++ this is required for the program to explicitly tell the operating system that a particular chunk of memory that was previously allocated is no longer needed. However, python is a _garbage collected_ language. I.e, the python runtime manages memory and decides that a chunk of memory is no longer needed/can be freed. The details of garbage collection are beyond the scope of this course. "
